# Bioinformatics Scripts

## **Overview** ## 

Here is a list of various Bash scripts I wrote and compiled duting my time at the [Kuang Lab](https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/kuang/) at the Dept of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. Each script is named with the task associated with it, along with the bioinformatics tool used for the task. An improved description of each script can be found commented in each script.
